Main Steps
Here are the main steps. We'll go over each of these in more detail on the following pages.
Gather two datasets - successfully extract data using two different data gathering methods and combine the data.
Assess the data according to quality and tidiness metrics, identifying missing data.
Clean the data to solve the issues found in the assessing step.
Update the data store with the cleaned data.
Produce visualizations on the cleaned data, and answer a brief research question on the dataset.
